# html
The html directory contains an example Ionic code showing out-of-the-box Ionic UI capabilities. Please note that the sample only demonstrates the UI and has no business logic/routing/API calls etc. 

* Open the index.html page to view the UI
* Resize page to view different resolutions
* Use query string parameter ionic:mode=ios to view iPhone/iPad type UI view
* Use query string parameter ui=2 to view the second theme 

All following URLs should work:
* index.html
* index.html?ui=2
* index.html?ionic:mode=ios
* index.html?ionic:mode=ios&ui=2

** It is not a perfect code, so please do expect errors **


# NextJs
The nextjs directory contains an example code showing how Ionic UI tags can be used in NextJs with SSR. The Ionic JS and CSS are also added to NextJs generated page so that a Clean UI on client Browser can be rendered. Please note that the sample only demonstrates the NextJS-based sample to build UI using Ionic and has no business logic/routing/API calls etc. 

* In the nextjs directory, open a terminal and execute "npm install" and  "npm run dev" to run the dev server
* Open http://localhost:3000 on your browser to view the  UI
* Resize page to view different supported resolutions
* Use query string parameter ionic:mode=ios to view iPhone/iPad type UI view
* Use query string parameter ui=2 to view the second theme 

All following URLs should work:
* http://localhost:3000
* http://localhost:3000?ui=2
* http://localhost:3000?ionic:mode=ios
* http://localhost:3000?ionic:mode=ios&ui=2

** It is not a perfect code, so please do expect errors **
