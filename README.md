# html
The html directory contains an example Ionic code showing out-of-the-box Ionic UI capabilities. Please note that the sample only demonstrates the UI and has no business logic/routing/API calls etc. 

* Open the index.html page to view the UI
* Resize page to view different resolutions
* Use query string parameter ionic:mode=ios to view iPhone/iPad type UI view
* Use query string parameter ui=2 to view the second theme 

All following urls should work:
* index.html
* index.html?ui=2
* index.html?ionic:mode=ios
* index.html?ionic:mode=ios&ui=2

** It is not a perfect code so do please expect errors **
